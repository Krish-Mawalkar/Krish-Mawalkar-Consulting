    <h1>Krish Mawalkar - Strategy Consulting</h1>
    <p>Hello, I'm Krish Mawalkar, a consultant with a passion for data-driven strategy and business growth. I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Statistics and Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University, where I'm gaining the skills to make data work for businesses like never before.</p>

    <p>My professional journey began as a co-founder of Arlington Consulting Group, a venture where we helped medium-sized clients with their strategy, marketing, and SEO projects. This entrepreneurial experience instilled in me a love for solving complex business challenges and working collaboratively with diverse teams.</p>

    <p>In addition to my entrepreneurial ventures, I've also gained valuable insights from the corporate world. I've worked as a Summer Finance Fellow at U.S. Bancorp, where I was immersed in the world of finance and banking. As an intern at a boutique sell-side M&A investment bank, I honed my skills in financial analysis and market research. I've also contributed to the financial landscape by serving as a Finance Intern for the State of Ohio.</p>

    <p>My journey in the world of business, finance, and consulting has been an exciting one, and I'm eager to continue exploring new opportunities and challenges in the ever-evolving landscape of strategy consulting. Feel free to connect with me to discuss potential collaborations or simply to share insights and ideas.</p>
