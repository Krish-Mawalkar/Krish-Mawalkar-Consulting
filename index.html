    <p><br>Hello! I'm Krish Mawalkar, an undergraduate student with professional interests in <i>data science</i> and <i>strategy consulting</i>. 
        Backed by my education in <a href="http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/schools-colleges/dietrichcollegeofhumanitiesandsocialsciences/departmentofstatistics/#statsmltextcontainer" target="_blank">Statistics and Machine Learning</a> at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, my mission is to strengthen Columbus companies through data science and management consulting projects.<br><br></p>

    <p>My professional journey began as a co-founder of Arlington Consulting Group, a venture where we helped medium-sized clients through strategy, marketing, and technical consulting projects. This entrepreneurial experience allowed me to solve complex challenges for businesses in Columbus and led to me working collaboratively with a diverse team of 7 technology and business student analysts from Columbus.<br><br></p>

    <p>In addition to my entrepreneurial ventures, I've also gained valuable insights from the corporate world. I've worked as a Summer Finance Fellow at U.S. Bancorp, where I completed a rotational program along Corporate Banking,  Corporate Finance, Wealth Management, and Business Banking tracks. 
        As an intern at a boutique sell-side M&A investment bank, I conducted financial analysis and market research projects in the food & beverage, energy, and consumer discretionary sectors. 
        I've also worked in Ohio as a Finance Intern for the State of Ohio at the state agency <i>Opportunities for Ohioans with Disabilities</i>.<br><br></p>

            <b>Executive Summary:</b> “The United States airline industry has historically been recognized for its success in transporting millions of passengers. Specifically, the Bureau of Transportation reports that, in 2022, U.S. airlines carried 853 million passengers. <br>
            However, U.S. airlines face challenges that are dragging their performance, resulting in delays for passengers. The purpose of this report is to predict flight delays based on datasets including flight traffic, airport, and weather information. The broader significance of this report is to help policy makers further understand what factors most affect airline delays, allowing for future actions to be implemented to decrease domestic airline delays. <br>
            The primary aim of this report is to formulate predictive models that effectively anticipate airline performance metrics, with a particular focus on arrival delays, by leveraging various traffic-specific metrics. The central research question our team sought to address revolved around the feasibility of accurately predicting the occurrence of delayed airline arrivals. <br>
            We utilized a Random Forest Regressor Model and Decision Tree Regressor Model as our main models. We used two Random Forest Regressor models which yielded an R-squared of 0.922 and an R-squared of 0.155. The model which produced the lower R-squared had its variable set altered which changed the outcome of the model. The Decision Tree Regressor yielded a R-squared of 0.846. The difference in our R-squareds demonstrate that there are specific variables that can help predict flight delay. Consequently, These R-squared values demonstrate that our model can reasonably identify flight arrival delays. <br> 
            The results indicate that there is a significant relationship between flight traffic, airport, and airline data and arrival delays. Our findings have important impacts for the airline industry and could allow airline companies to better communicate with their passengers about arrival times to ensure a smoother customer experience.
