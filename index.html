    <h1>Krish Mawalkar
    <br>Strategy Consulting</h1>
    
    <p>Hello! I'm Krish Mawalkar, a consultant with a passion for data-driven strategy and business growth. I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Statistics and Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University, where I'm gaining the skills to make data work for businesses like never before.<br><br></p>

    <p>My professional journey began as a co-founder of Arlington Consulting Group, a venture where we helped medium-sized clients with their strategy, marketing, and SEO projects. This entrepreneurial experience allowed me to solve complex challenges for businesses in Columbus and led to me working collaboratively with a diverse team of 7 technology and business student analysts from Columbus.<br><br></p>

    <p>In addition to my entrepreneurial ventures, I've also gained valuable insights from the corporate world. I've worked as a Summer Finance Fellow at U.S. Bancorp, where I completed a rotational program along Corporate Banking,  Corporate Finance, Wealth Management, and Business Banking. 
        As an intern at a boutique sell-side M&A investment bank, I have conducted financial analysis and market research projects in the food & beverage, energy, and consumer discretionary sectors. 
        I've also contributed to Ohio by working as a Finance Intern for the State of Ohio at the state agency Opportunities for Ohioans with Disabilities.<br><br></p>

    <p>I serve on the Undergraduate Entrepreneurship Association's Board and supported the Carnegie Mellon Venture Challenge, allowing me to moderate a session with Vinod Khosla, one of our keynote speakers.
        <br> I am also in 180 Degrees Consulting (pro bono consulting) as a consultant serving web development and healthcare clients.
        <br> As debate is a passion of mine, I have judged debater at Harvard, Princeton, Georgetown, the University of Pennsylvania tournaments, and various other speech & debate competitions.
        <br> In 2021, I was named a U.S. National Karate Champion.<br><br>
    </p>

    <p>My journey in the world of business, finance, and consulting has been an exciting one, and I'm eager to continue exploring new opportunities and challenges in the ever-evolving landscape of strategy consulting. Feel free to connect with me to discuss potential collaborations or simply to share insights and ideas.</p>
